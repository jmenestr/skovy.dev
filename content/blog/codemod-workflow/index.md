Since originally writing about
[creating a custom transform with jscodeshift](/jscodeshift-custom-transform),
I've had the opportunity to write many more. In the process, I've settled
into a standard workflow for creating codemods while approaching new problems.

On the surface, codemods seem daunting, particularly dealing with
the abstract syntax tree. But with the right tools and workflow,
it can become a breeze. By the end of this post, you should be
comfortable with the basics of understanding how to interact with
the abstract syntax tree, differences between auditing and
transforming code, and a few invaluable tools.

## Workflow

The first question I ask is whether I'm trying to audit code, or
trying to transform (codemod) code. A code audit is useful for
understanding the current state of the code without making changes.
On the other hand, a code transform is useful for making
changes to existing code.

For example, say there is a function. If you'd like to know how
many times that function is used, or which arguments are passed,
this is an audit. If you'd like to rename the function, or
change the order of arguments, this is a transform.

You might be wondering how code audits are related and why
it's included in a post about codemods. Code audits were a
concept that I never considered before I started working with
codemods. They both start off in the same way: find a specific
piece of code. They differ only in output: an audit aggregates
information about the code usage, while a transform changes
the code. Often, I'll do a code audit to understand the current
state of the code in aggregate before making any changes, because
it surfaces important information and often influences how I
approach making changes to the code. Fortunately, this also means
most of the code can be reused between the two since they both
target the same piece of code.

### Auditing versus Transforming

For code audits, I start with [`@babel/parser`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-parser)
and [`@babel/traverse`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-traverse).
This approach requires combining a few packages, but this means it's
more flexible. It works particularly well for keeping track of things
_across_ files.

For code transforms, I reach for [`jscodeshift`](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift).
This is an all-in-one tool and doesn't require pulling in additional
packages but means it's specialized only for transforming code, and
not as flexible for other tasks like code audits. Depending on the
[exact configuration](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift#parser),
it may actually use `@babel/parser` under-the-hood.

### Understanding the Abstract Syntax Tree

With either approach, the first step is to understand the code
you're working with. Both tools convert a string of code into
an abstract syntax tree (AST). This is a fancy name for creating
a tree data structure with each node in the tree representing a
specific piece of the code.

For example, let's say the following code is parsed with `@babel/parser`:

```js
const a = 1,
  b = 2;
```

It will produce the following JSON structure. Note that many of the
properties have been removed for readability, but the structure is
intact.

```json
{
  "type": "VariableDeclaration",
  "declarations": [
    {
      "type": "VariableDeclarator",
      "id": {
        "type": "Identifier",
        "name": "a"
      },
      "init": {
        "type": "NumericLiteral",
        "value": 1
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "VariableDeclarator",
      "id": {
        "type": "Identifier",
        "name": "b"
      },
      "init": {
        "type": "NumericLiteral",
        "value": 2
      }
    }
  ],
  "kind": "const"
}
```

In a more visual representation, that would produce the following tree structure.

![Example Abstract Syntax Tree](./images/basic-ast.png)

In this example, the entire snippet is a single variable declaration,
and it declares two variables (variable declarators). Each of these
declared variables have a name (identifier) and a value (in this case,
a numeric value).

The exact tree structure may differ depending on the parser,
but the important part is understanding that this is the
abstract syntax tree we'll be working with. While the exact names
and structure might seem complex, it's not important
to memorize these since the AST for any code snippet can be quickly
explored using [astexplorer.net](https://astexplorer.net).

This tool is invaluable to understand the AST for a given piece
of code. One mistake I commonly make is forgetting to change the
parser in AST Explorer, make sure this aligns with the parser you're using
otherwise you can end up with different trees.

### Writing the code

After understanding the relevant AST for the code snippet, it's time to
write the code. As seen, the AST names and structure can be complex.
As a result, it's easy to make a typo when working with properties
and node names, or forget to check that the node is the correct type.

For example, in the above code snippet it might seem like the `init`
property for the variable decelerator always points to a numeric value.
While it's true for this example, that's not always the case.

```js
const a = 1,
  b = init();
```

This updated code snippet initializes `b` with a function instead of a
numeric value. The `init` property will now point to a "call expression"
node (not a "numeric value" node). If you only care about one of these,
it's important to check the node's type before accessing properties
since many properties only exist on specific types of nodes. Including
these checks can be easy to overlook. This may not be an issue in
smaller codebases, but becomes a real issue in larger codebases.

Fortunately, both tools have type definitions available:

- [`@types/babel__traverse`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/babel__traverse) - when working with `@babel/traverse`
- [`@types/jscodeshift`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/jscodeshift) - when working with `jscodeshift`

First, the types can help catch any typos when working with nodes.
Second, they will validate that the node is only the type you expect and
will raise a type error otherwise.

## Example

Now that the steps have been outlined, what does this look like
in practice? Let's start by defining a simple "codebase" that contains
a `coffee` object with a property to `brew` coffee.

```js
// coffee.js
export const coffee = {
  brew: (water, grounds) => {
    if (water && grounds) {
      return "â˜•";
    }
  }
};
```

This is then used in a few files, to make a few cups of coffee. â˜•

```js
// src/firstCup.js
import { coffee } from "./coffee";

export const firstCup = coffee.brew("ðŸ’§", "ðŸ’©");
```

```js
// src/secondCup.js
import { coffee } from "./coffee";

export const secondCup = coffee.brew("ðŸŒŠ", "ðŸ’©");
```

```js
// src/thirdCup.js
import { coffee } from "./coffee";

export const thirdCup = coffee.brew("ðŸš¿", "ðŸ’©");
```

After a while, we realize there are a couple of ways
the function is being used. Specifically, several
different types of `water`. We decide that we want to
update `brew` to only accept one type of water.

```js
export const coffee = {
  brew: (water, grounds) => {
    if (water === "???" && grounds) {
      return "â˜•";
    }
  }
};
```

Before choosing which `water` argument to allow, lets understand how
it's used today. If most usages already use the same water argument,
it makes the most sense to use that one. Otherwise, any can be chosen.

### Code Audit

To start auditing the code, let's install the babel packages
along with a few others to help with reading files and executing the code.

- [`@babel/parser`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-parser) - parse a string of code into an AST
- [`@babel/traverse`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-traverse) _([and types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/babel__traverse))_ - helps traverse the AST and find specific nodes
- [`glob`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) _([and types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/glob))_ - find the files to audit using glob patterns
- [`ts-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) - replacement for node capable of handling TypeScript files
- [`typescript`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) - required for TypeScript support
- [`fs`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) - read file contents

These packages can be combined to create a script to find, read,
and parse files to traverse their AST.

```typescript
// audit.ts
import { parse } from "@babel/parser";
import traverse from "@babel/traverse";
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as glob from "glob";

// Find all files relevant files.
const files = glob.sync("./src/*.js");

files.forEach(file => {
  const contents = fs.readFileSync(file).toString();

  const ast = parse(contents, {
    sourceType: "module",
    plugins: [
      // Note: depending on the code being parsed, you
      // may need to add plugins such as `jsx` or others
      // to support specific syntax. Docs:
      // https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-parser#plugins
    ]
  });

  traverse(ast, {
    // Find the code we care about...
  });
});
```

This script template will find all files matching the
specified glob pattern (all `.js` files in the `src` directory).
For each of those files that is found, it then reads
that file's contents. The contents is still a string,
so the next step is to `parse` it and generate an
abstract syntax tree. Finally, we're ready to `traverse`
that tree.

The next step is to figure out how to traverse the tree to
find the specific piece of code we care about. This is
where [astexplorer.net](https://astexplorer.net)
comes into play. First, checking that the parser is
correct.

![AST Explorer Parser Option](./images/ast-explorer-parser.png)

Then, pasting in a sample code snippet that we're looking for.

```
coffee.brew("ðŸ’§", "ðŸ’©")
```

Note that removing as much of the irrelevant code as possible
(eg: the `export` and `const` variable deceleration)
can help simplify understanding the AST. Again, with some
of the properties removed for readability, this code produces
the following JSON representing the AST.

```json
{
  "type": "ExpressionStatement",
  "expression": {
    "type": "CallExpression",
    "callee": {
      "type": "MemberExpression",
      "object": {
        "type": "Identifier",
        "name": "coffee"
      },
      "computed": false,
      "property": {
        "type": "Identifier",
        "name": "brew"
      }
    },
    "arguments": [
      {
        "type": "StringLiteral",
        "value": "ðŸ’§"
      },
      {
        "type": "StringLiteral",
        "value": "ðŸ’©"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Before writing any code, we can state what we're looking
for based on this AST:

> We want to know the `arguments` of a `CallExpression` node,
> where the `callee.object.name` is `coffee` and the
> `callee.property.name` is `brew`.

There are a number of ways this can be done with `traverse`, but my
general approach is to take the type of the highest node in the
tree that is specific to the code I care about and use that as
the entrypoint. In this case, that's `CallExpression`.

```ts
// audit.ts
traverse(ast, {
  CallExpression(path) {
    const { node } = path;
  }
});
```

As the AST is being traversed, any `CallExpression` nodes will be
passed to this function. It passes a `path` which has
a `node` property that corresponds to the node in the AST.
The `path` is a wrapper with some other metadata, such
as the `parent` node that can be helpful to traverse up the tree
if needed.

This will target any `CallExpression` node, but the above
description had several other constraints, so let's
apply all of those.

```ts
// audit.ts
traverse(ast, {
  CallExpression(path) {
    const { node } = path;

    if (
      node.callee.object.name === "coffee" &&
      node.callee.property.name === "brew"
    ) {
      console.log(node.arguments);
    }
  }
});
```

Great, this finds exactly what we care about:
which parameters are being passed to `coffee.brew`.
For this example, we could stop here.
However, once this reaches hundreds of files, there are
likely two problems to emerge. First, `node.callee.type`
could be something other than a `MemberExpression`,
which means `node.callee.object.name` or `node.callee.property.name`
may not always exist. That means this could throw a runtime
error.

Since this file was written in TypeScript and the corresponding
type definitions were installed. This means that several type
are being thrown with the current solution.

```typescript
traverse(ast, {
  CallExpression(path) {
    const { node } = path;

    if (
      node.callee.object.name === "coffee" &&
      //          ^^^^^^
      // Property 'object' does not exist on type
      // 'ArrayExpression | ... 44 more ... | V8IntrinsicIdentifier'.
      node.callee.property.name === "brew"
      //          ^^^^^^^^
      // Property 'property' does not exist on type
      // 'ArrayExpression | ... 44 more ... | V8IntrinsicIdentifier'
    ) {
      console.log(node.arguments);
    }
  }
});
```

Fixing these type errors also results in a much more robust script
because each node's type is verified before any properties are accessed.
This prevents unexpected runtime error such as trying to read a property
of `undefined`.

```typescript
traverse(ast, {
  CallExpression(path) {
    const { node } = path;

    if (
      node.callee.type === "MemberExpression" &&
      node.callee.object.type === "Identifier" &&
      node.callee.object.name === "coffee" &&
      node.callee.property.type === "Identifier" &&
      node.callee.property.name === "brew"
    ) {
      console.log(node.arguments);
    }
  }
});
```

Second, the arguments are being logged to the console.
This is going to be very noisy and almost impossible to
determine the most used. For this, we can create a global
object and increment counters for different values. In this
case, since we care about two parameter values, an array
with two corresponding objects can be added with logic
to increment a counter each time an argument is used in
that position.

```typescript
import { parse } from "@babel/parser";
import traverse from "@babel/traverse";
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as glob from "glob";

// Keep track of which args are passed to `coffee.brew`.
const args = [
  {}, // tracks first argument
  {} // tracks second argument
];

// Find all files relevant files.
const files = glob.sync("./src/*.js");

files.forEach(file => {
  const contents = fs.readFileSync(file).toString();

  const ast = parse(contents, {
    sourceType: "module",
    plugins: []
  });

  traverse(ast, {
    CallExpression(path) {
      const { node } = path;

      if (
        node.callee.type === "MemberExpression" &&
        node.callee.object.type === "Identifier" &&
        node.callee.object.name === "coffee" &&
        node.callee.property.type === "Identifier" &&
        node.callee.property.name === "brew"
      ) {
        node.arguments.forEach((argument, index) => {
          if (argument.type !== "StringLiteral") return;

          const { value } = argument;
          if (args[index][value]) {
            args[index][value] += 1;
          } else {
            args[index][value] = 1;
          }
        });
      }
    }
  });
});

console.log(args);
```

Running this (`yarn ts-node ./audit.ts`) complete script now logs the following.

```json
[{ "ðŸ’§": 1, "ðŸŒŠ": 1, "ðŸš¿": 1 }, { "ðŸ’©": 3 }]
```

With this output, we can now say how the existing code
was used. There were three invocations of `coffee.brew`,
with three different water arguments, always the
same coffee grounds argument. Let's pick `"ðŸ’§"` as
the only permitted option and update the original
function.

```js
// src/coffee.js
export const coffee = {
  brew: (water, grounds) => {
    if (water === "ðŸ’§" && grounds) {
      return "â˜•";
    }
  }
};
```

Now there's a problem, two out of the three usages will
no longer properly brew coffee. For this example, the
quickest fix is to manually update the two files. For the
purposes of this example, lets imagine this is used
across many more files. Not only will it take a long time,
it can be challenging to keep it all in your head, and the
chances of making a mistake increases with each file.

### Code Transform

Instead, a codemod, or transform can be applied to the existing
code. It automates the process so it can be applied to any number
of files. Assuming the logic is accurate, it's also more reliable
than repeatedly making the same manual changes.

To get started, only one new dependency needs to be added.

- [`jscodeshift`](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) _([and types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/jscodeshift))_ - toolkit for running codemods

Now, we can create a file named `transform.ts` to contain
our codemod, or transformation with the basics.

```ts
// transform.ts
import { Transform } from "jscodeshift";

const transform: Transform = (file, api) => {
  // Alias the jscodeshift API for ease of use.
  const j = api.jscodeshift;

  // Convert the entire file source into a collection of nodes paths.
  const root = j(file.source);

  return root.toSource();
};

export default transform;
```

This sets up a jscodeshift transform as the default export. It's
also importing the `Transform` type so that all the parameters and
therefore the internals are properly typed. The parameters are defined
and passed in by jscodeshift.

The first thing this transform does is create an alias for the
jscodeshift API (`j`). Depending on the complexity of the transform,
it can be used often. Then, it converts the file's source string into an AST
and has a reference to it's `root`. Finally, it's converting the AST back
into a source string which will get written back to the file.

The transform can then be ran: `jscodeshift -t ./transform.ts --parser babylon ./src`.
Right now, this will be identical to what already exists in each file
since no changes are being made in the transform. Note that the `parser`
is explicitly set to `babylon`. The default is `babel` which uses an
[`estree` plugin](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift/blob/48f5d6d6e5e769639b958f1a955c83c68157a5fa/parser/babel5Compat.js#L24) which
results in a [slightly different AST](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-parser#output).

To make the transformation, the AST can be mutated before
it's converted back to a source string. To start, we
need to find the specific node we care about.
Fortunately, much of this logic is identical to the audit
script, but with a slightly different API.

```ts
// transform.ts
import { Transform } from "jscodeshift";

const transform: Transform = (file, api) => {
  const j = api.jscodeshift;
  const root = j(file.source);

  root.find(j.CallExpression).filter(path => {
    const { node } = path;

    if (
      node.callee.type === "MemberExpression" &&
      node.callee.object.type === "Identifier" &&
      node.callee.object.name === "coffee" &&
      node.callee.property.type === "Identifier" &&
      node.callee.property.name === "brew"
    ) {
      const [waterArg] = node.arguments;
      return waterArg.type === "StringLiteral" && waterArg.value !== "ðŸ’§";
    }
  });

  return root.toSource();
};

export default transform;
```

There are several different ways this can be achieved with `jscodeshift`.
The approach taken here is to find all `CallExpression` nodes, then filter
based on their properties. This is finding all invocations of `coffee.brew`
where the first argument _isn't_ `"ðŸ’§"`. Now we have a collection of
nodes that need to be transformed.

```ts
// transform.ts
import { Transform } from "jscodeshift";

const transform: Transform = (file, api) => {
  const j = api.jscodeshift;
  const root = j(file.source);

  root
    .find(j.CallExpression)
    .filter(path => {
      const { node } = path;

      if (
        node.callee.type === "MemberExpression" &&
        node.callee.object.type === "Identifier" &&
        node.callee.object.name === "coffee" &&
        node.callee.property.type === "Identifier" &&
        node.callee.property.name === "brew"
      ) {
        const [waterArg] = node.arguments;
        return waterArg.type === "StringLiteral" && waterArg.value !== "ðŸ’§";
      }
    })
    .replaceWith(path => {
      const { node } = path;

      const [waterArg] = node.arguments;
      if (waterArg.type === "StringLiteral") {
        waterArg.value = "ðŸ’§";
      }

      return node;
    });

  return root.toSource();
};

export default transform;
```

This can be achieved with `replaceWith`. This is invoked on each node
in this collection, so the first argument's `value` can be mutated
and then returned as the new node. Alternatively, an entirely new
node could have been created using [builders](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift#builders).

This is only a simplified example, but `jscodeshift` provides
many other helpers (eg: `findJSXElements(name)`) and optimizations,
such as parallelizing the transformation to perform them faster which
can provide a noticeable difference in larger codebases.

## Conclusion

In summary, my codemod workflow is:

1. **Problem**: some problem arises that requires a large refactoring.
1. **Perform a code audit**: understand the current state of the code.
1. **Determine the new code structure**: based on the needs and concrete
   usage data from the audit, decide on the way the code should be structured.
1. **Perform a codemod**: transform the existing code to comply with the new structure.
1. **Bonus**: using the same AST logic, [add a custom ESLint rule](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules) to prevent future misuses.

All code can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/skovy/typescript-codemod-examples).
